# EDAV Project on the TEDS-A Dataset

## Overview
This project explores patterns and insights into drug abuse and addiction using the **Treatment Episode Data Set â€“ Admissions (TEDS-A)** dataset. Through extensive data analysis and visualization, we aimed to uncover the cultural, economic, and behavioral factors influencing substance abuse, as well as the addictive nature of specific drugs. Below are the key findings from our research.

## Key Findings

### 1. **Cultural Influence on Drug Abuse**
- **Observation**: Cultural attitudes significantly shape opinions and behaviors towards drug use.
- **Example**: 
  - **Indian respondents**: Displayed conservative attitudes towards drug use, reflected in lower rates of abuse and fewer categories of substances used.
  - **White respondents**: Exhibited more openness to drug use, correlated with higher rates of addiction across various substance categories.
- **Conclusion**: A culture of openness can lead to higher addiction rates, emphasizing the need for culturally tailored prevention strategies.

### 2. **Socioeconomic Factors and Work-Life Balance**
- **Hypothesis Verification**:
  - **Poverty**: Found to be a strong driver of addiction.
  - **Employment**: Surprisingly, employment status alone does not directly influence substance use or affordability.
- **Unexpected Insight**:
  - **Part-time workers**: Reported the lowest rates of substance abuse, much lower than full-time employees or unemployed individuals.
- **Conclusion**: Work-life balance plays a critical role in relieving work-related stress and preventing addiction. Programs promoting balanced lifestyles could be effective in combating substance abuse.

### 3. **Addiction Trends Among Younger Respondents**
- **Finding**: Methamphetamine addiction is notably prevalent among younger individuals, highlighting a clear age-related pattern of substance abuse.
- **Implication**:
  - Education and preventative measures targeting minors are essential.
  - Increased focus on protecting young people from exposure to highly addictive substances like methamphetamine is crucial.

### 4. **Addictiveness of Specific Drugs**
- **Insights**:
  - **Heroin and Methamphetamine**: Exhibit strong addictive properties, often requiring daily use due to dependency.
  - **Alcohol**: Comparatively less addictive in terms of frequency but still poses significant risks with excessive consumption.
- **Recommendation**: Extreme caution is necessary when dealing with highly addictive substances like heroin and methamphetamine, as they pose severe risks to public health.

## Methodology
Our analysis involved:
- **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessing the TEDS-A dataset to handle missing and inconsistent data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Using visualization and statistical techniques to identify trends and patterns.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Validating key socioeconomic and cultural factors associated with substance abuse.
- **Visualization**: Creating informative plots and charts to communicate findings effectively.

## Conclusion
This project highlights the multifaceted nature of substance abuse, influenced by cultural, socioeconomic, and demographic factors. It underscores the need for targeted prevention strategies, especially for younger populations and those exposed to highly addictive substances. Our findings also demonstrate the importance of balancing work and life to mitigate stress and its associated risks.

## Future Work
- Expand the analysis to include longitudinal data for tracking addiction patterns over time.
- Investigate additional cultural and regional factors to further refine prevention strategies.
- Explore the role of mental health and social support systems in addiction prevention and recovery.
