    "text": "The Treatment Episode Data Set - Admissions (TEDS-A) provides rich, standardized data on individuals admitted to substance use treatment facilities across the United States. I chose this dataset because it offers a comprehensive view of the demographic, clinical, and socio-economic characteristics of individuals seeking help for substance use disorders. Substance use is a critical public health issue, with profound implications for individuals, families, and communities.\nBy analyzing this dataset, we are curious about uncovering patterns and trends in substance use and treatment access, which could help identify gaps in the system, informing public policy, and improving treatment outcomes. Meanwhile, what’s the common or even uncommon causes of typical type of abuses, and more insights for prevention, as well as the association between use of substance and all kinds of factors from individual scale to social scale are all our potential research, based on the analysis results.\nSome questions could be explored more:\n(Demographic Patterns) What are the demographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, race) of individuals admitted to substance use treatment? Are there observable disparities in treatment access across different populations?\n(Substance Use Trends) What are the most commonly reported substances leading to treatment admission, and how do they vary by demographic factors? How does the age of first use correlate with the type and frequency of substance use?\n(Treatment and Outcomes) What are the most common types of treatment services provided, and how do they vary across regions? Does the use of medication-assisted treatments (MATs) differ based on the type of substance? Socio-Economic Correlations:\nMore context about this dataset: Substance use disorders (SUDs) affect millions of individuals worldwide. These disorders are characterized by an inability to control the use of substances despite adverse consequences. Commonly abused substances include alcohol, opioids, stimulants, and marijuana. The opioid crisis, in particular, has highlighted the urgent need for effective interventions.\nThe TEDS-A dataset, collected by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), serves as a vital resource for understanding trends in substance use and treatment services. It includes data on admissions to state-licensed treatment facilities, focusing on factors such as demographics, substance use history, and the type of treatment received.\nAnalyzing this dataset provides insights into the scope of substance use issues and the efficacy of current treatment approaches. This understanding can support efforts to design better-targeted interventions, allocate resources more effectively, and reduce the societal burden of substance use disorders.\nPersonal Motivation: I am particularly interested in this topic because of its direct relevance to public health and the opportunity it provides to use data-driven approaches to address real-world challenges. The interplay between socio-economic factors, demographic characteristics, and substance use patterns fascinates me, as it offers a window into systemic inequalities and areas for improvement in healthcare delivery.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nFor this project, we propose using the Treatment Episode Data Set - Admissions (TEDS-A), 2021, which is managed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). This dataset exclusively contains records of substance use treatment admissions that occurred in the year 2021 across the United States. The data is collected by state agencies from state-licensed or certified treatment centers that receive public funding. It encompasses both administrative details and self-reported information from individuals at the time of admission, making it a valuable resource for studying substance use treatment trends.\nThe dataset is provided in multiple formats, including SAS, SPSS, Stata, R, and ASCII comma-delimited files, ensuring compatibility with diverse analytical tools. The availability of the dataset in R format facilitates efficient analysis within RStudio, which will be used for this project. The 2021 dataset contains 1,482,543 records, each corresponding to a unique treatment admission. The key variables include demographic information such as age, gender, and race; substance use details like primary, secondary, and tertiary substances; and service-related attributes such as referral source and type of treatment received.\nFor processing and analysis, we will exclusively use R. We plan to utilize the tidyverse suite of packages for data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization. The haven package will be used to import the dataset, allowing seamless handling of SPSS or Stata formats. Additionally, dplyr will be employed for filtering, grouping, and summarizing the data, while ggplot2 will be used to visualize trends and relationships. Comprehensive documentation provided by SAMHSA, including user manuals and crosswalks, will ensure that variables are accurately interpreted and used appropriately in the analysis. The dataset and its documentation are publicly available through SAMHSA’s official data portal.",

    "section": "2.2 Missing value analysis",
    "text": "2.2 Missing value analysis\nWhile the TEDS-A dataset provides extensive coverage of treatment admissions in 2021, it has several limitations due to missing or incomplete data. Some variables contain a significant proportion of missing values, coded as -9 to denote unknown, invalid, or uncollected data. For example, the pregnancy status variable is missing for 68.8% of cases, primarily because this variable is not applicable to male clients. Employment status has 17.0% missing data, likely reflecting cases where the information was unavailable or not collected. Similarly, frequency of substance use for primary substances has 18.8% missing values. These missing data points can pose challenges for analysis by reducing the reliability of certain conclusions.\nAdditionally, reporting practices vary across states, which can lead to discrepancies. For instance, some states exclude data from private or hospital-based facilities, while others omit specific populations such as those in correctional institutions. These differences must be considered when interpreting the dataset, as they may affect representativeness and comparability between states.\nTo address missing data, we will use a systematic approach within R. For categorical variables like pregnancy status and employment status, we will create a separate category for missing values. This ensures that missing data is accounted for without distorting distributions through imputation. For numerical variables, such as age at first use or days waiting for treatment, we will analyze patterns of missingness and decide on appropriate imputation methods. For instance, if the missing values are randomly distributed, we may use the median or mode for imputation. However, for variables where more than 50% of values are missing, such as detailed criminal justice referral, these variables may be excluded from certain analyses to prevent introducing bias.\nHandling missing data will rely on R packages like tidyr and mice for managing and imputing missing values. Visual tools from ggplot2 will help identify patterns in missingness and validate the chosen methods. This comprehensive approach ensures that missing data is appropriately managed without compromising the quality or integrity of the analysis. By leveraging the flexibility and analytical power of R, we aim to effectively mitigate the impact of missing data while maintaining the dataset’s analytical utility.",
