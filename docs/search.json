    "text": "The Treatment Episode Data Set - Admissions (TEDS-A) provides rich, standardized data on individuals admitted to substance use treatment facilities across the United States. I chose this dataset because it offers a comprehensive view of the demographic, clinical, and socio-economic characteristics of individuals seeking help for substance use disorders. Substance use is a critical public health issue, with profound implications for individuals, families, and communities.\nBy analyzing this dataset, we are curious about uncovering patterns and trends in substance use and treatment access, which could help identify gaps in the system, informing public policy, and improving treatment outcomes. Meanwhile, what’s the common or even uncommon causes of typical type of abuses, and more insights for prevention, as well as the association between use of substance and all kinds of factors from individual scale to social scale are all our potential research, based on the analysis results.\nSome questions could be explored more:\n(Demographic Patterns) What are the demographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, race) of individuals admitted to substance use treatment? Are there observable disparities in treatment access across different populations?\n(Substance Use Trends) What are the most commonly reported substances leading to treatment admission, and how do they vary by demographic factors? How does the age of first use correlate with the type and frequency of substance use?\n(Treatment and Outcomes) What are the most common types of treatment services provided, and how do they vary across regions? Does the use of medication-assisted treatments (MATs) differ based on the type of substance? Socio-Economic Correlations:\nMore context about this dataset: Substance use disorders (SUDs) affect millions of individuals worldwide. These disorders are characterized by an inability to control the use of substances despite adverse consequences. Commonly abused substances include alcohol, opioids, stimulants, and marijuana. The opioid crisis, in particular, has highlighted the urgent need for effective interventions.\nThe TEDS-A dataset, collected by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), serves as a vital resource for understanding trends in substance use and treatment services. It includes data on admissions to state-licensed treatment facilities, focusing on factors such as demographics, substance use history, and the type of treatment received.\nAnalyzing this dataset provides insights into the scope of substance use issues and the efficacy of current treatment approaches. This understanding can support efforts to design better-targeted interventions, allocate resources more effectively, and reduce the societal burden of substance use disorders.\nPersonal Motivation: I am particularly interested in this topic because of its direct relevance to public health and the opportunity it provides to use data-driven approaches to address real-world challenges. The interplay between socio-economic factors, demographic characteristics, and substance use patterns fascinates me, as it offers a window into systemic inequalities and areas for improvement in healthcare delivery.",

    "text": "The data we use in this project is TEDS-A dataset, and the time period we use is year 2021. The link for this dataset is https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/teds/datafiles.\nFor this project, we propose using the Treatment Episode Data Set - Admissions (TEDS-A), 2021, which is managed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). This dataset exclusively contains records of substance use treatment admissions that occurred in the year 2021 across the United States. The data is collected by state agencies from state-licensed or certified treatment centers that receive public funding. It encompasses both administrative details and self-reported information from individuals at the time of admission, making it a valuable resource for studying substance use treatment trends.\nThe dataset is provided in multiple formats, including SAS, SPSS, Stata, R, and ASCII comma-delimited files, ensuring compatibility with diverse analytical tools. The availability of the dataset in R format facilitates efficient analysis within RStudio, which will be used for this project. The 2021 dataset contains 1,482,543 records, each corresponding to a unique treatment admission. The key variables include demographic information such as age, gender, and race; substance use details like primary, secondary, and tertiary substances; and service-related attributes such as referral source and type of treatment received.\nFor processing and analysis, we will exclusively use R. We plan to utilize the tidyverse suite of packages for data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization. The haven package will be used to import the dataset, allowing seamless handling of SPSS or Stata formats. Additionally, dplyr will be employed for filtering, grouping, and summarizing the data, while ggplot2 will be used to visualize trends and relationships. Comprehensive documentation provided by SAMHSA, including user manuals and crosswalks, will ensure that variables are accurately interpreted and used appropriately in the analysis. The dataset and its documentation are publicly available through SAMHSA’s official data portal.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(redav)\n\n\nLoading required package: ggplot2\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nload(\"data/rawdata.rdata\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(haven)\n\ntedsa_puf_2021_r &lt;- as.data.frame(lapply(tedsa_puf_2021_r, function(col) {\n  if (inherits(col, \"haven_labelled\")) {\n    haven::as_factor(col)  \n  } else {\n    col\n  }\n}))\n\ntedsa_puf_2021_r[tedsa_puf_2021_r == -9] &lt;- NA\n\n\nWhile the TEDS-A dataset provides extensive coverage of treatment admissions in 2021, it has several limitations due to missing or incomplete data. Some variables contain a significant proportion of missing values, invalid, or uncollected data. For example, employment status has 17.0% missing data, likely reflecting cases where the information was unavailable or not collected. Similarly, frequency of substance use for primary substances has 18.8% missing values.

For categorical variables like pregnancy status and employment status, we will create a separate category for missing values. This ensures that missing data is accounted for without distorting distributions through imputation. For numerical variables, such as age at first use or days waiting for treatment, we will analyze patterns of missingness and decide on appropriate imputation methods. For instance, if the missing values are randomly distributed, we may use the median or mode for imputation. However, for variables where more than 50% of values are missing, such as detailed criminal justice referral, these variables may be excluded from certain analyses to prevent introducing bias.\nHandling missing data will rely on R packages like tidyr and mice for managing and imputing missing values. Visual tools from ggplot2 will help identify patterns in missingness and validate the chosen methods. This comprehensive approach ensures that missing data is appropriately managed without compromising the quality or integrity of the analysis. By leveraging the flexibility and analytical power of R, we aim to effectively mitigate the impact of missing data while maintaining the dataset’s analytical utility.",

    "text": "2.2 Missing value analysis\nWhile the TEDS-A dataset provides extensive coverage of treatment admissions in 2021, it has several limitations due to missing or incomplete data. Some variables contain a significant proportion of missing values, coded as -9 to denote unknown, invalid, or uncollected data. For example, the pregnancy status variable is missing for 68.8% of cases, primarily because this variable is not applicable to male clients. Employment status has 17.0% missing data, likely reflecting cases where the information was unavailable or not collected. Similarly, frequency of substance use for primary substances has 18.8% missing values. These missing data points can pose challenges for analysis by reducing the reliability of certain conclusions.\nAdditionally, reporting practices vary across states, which can lead to discrepancies. For instance, some states exclude data from private or hospital-based facilities, while others omit specific populations such as those in correctional institutions. These differences must be considered when interpreting the dataset, as they may affect representativeness and comparability between states.\nTo address missing data, we will use a systematic approach within R.

That may come from more male data in this set. Overall speaking, there is no obvious frequency difference in abuse type of different gender.\nFor further insight, we decide to look into the four main abuse type and it’s association with respondents characteristic. When it comes to characteristic difference, race of respondents is always an important factor. Taking the four main races, we try to find out it’s association with abuse type.\n\n\nCode\ndata_top4_all &lt;- data |&gt;\n  mutate(across(everything(), ~ {\n    top4 &lt;- names(sort(table(.x), decreasing = TRUE))[1:4]\n    ifelse(.x %in% top4, as.character(.x), NA)\n  }))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmosaic(~ RACE + SUB1, \n       data = data_top4_all,\n       direction = c(\"v\", \"h\"),  \n       gp_labels = gpar(fontsize = 7),\n       gp_varnames = gpar(fontsize = 9),\n       main_gp = gpar(fontsize = 15),\n       labeling_args = list(\n         set_varnames = c(RACE = \"RACE\", SUB1 = \"Substances\"),\n         rot_labels = c(left = 0, top = 20)\n         ),\n       margins = unit(c(1, 1, 1, 5), \"lines\"),\n       gp = gpar(fill = c(\"lightblue\", \"lightblue\", \"lightblue\", \"lightblue\", \n                          \"lightpink\", \"lightpink\", \"lightpink\", \"lightpink\",\n                          \"peachpuff1\", \"peachpuff1\", \"peachpuff1\", \"peachpuff1\",\n                          \"lightgreen\", \"lightgreen\", \"lightgreen\", \"lightgreen\"))\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this plot, it can be seen that there is some correlation between RACE and Substance usage: Indian are conservative about the use of drug, so they tend to drink alcohol much more than any other type. In contrast, while people are more open to the use of all kinds of drugs, so each has a similar proportion. So the opinions towards drugs are severely affected by culture, and we can still use the stacked bar chat to check if the total amount of substance usage corresponds with race.\n\n\nCode\ndata_summary_race &lt;- data |&gt;\n  group_by(RACE) |&gt;\n  summarise(total_count = n()) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total_count))\n\ndata$RACE &lt;- factor(data$RACE, levels = data_summary_race$RACE)\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndata &lt;- data |&gt;\n  mutate(SUB1 = fct_infreq(SUB1))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data, aes(x = RACE, fill = SUB1)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"stack\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Abuse Type by Race\",\n    x = \"RACE\",\n    y = \"Count\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_discrete(name = NULL) +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(ncol = 2)) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1, size = 8),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 8),\n    legend.title = element_text(size = 10),\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stacked bar chart illustrates how the primary substance used varies across different races. White stands out with the highest overall substance counts and the broadest variety of substances. Black or African American follows, with fewer counts but still a noticeable presence of several key substances. The group identified as American Indian (other than Alaska Native) ranks third, showing less but still noticeable use use of substances. This graph verifies our conclusion that how cultures affect people’s opinion on drug usage, not only from the type, but also number of abuse: open culture and opinion causes much more addiction, understandably.\n\n\nCode\ntable_2 &lt;- table(data$RACE, data$SUB1)\ndf_table_2 &lt;- as.data.frame(table_2)\ncolnames(df_table_2) &lt;- c(\"RACE\", \"SUB1\", \"Freq\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df_table_2, aes(x = RACE, y = SUB1, fill = Freq)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\") + \n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"white\", high = \"steelblue\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Abuse Type Heatmap by Race\",\n    x = \"RACE\",\n    y = \"Substances\",\n    fill = \"Count\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 8)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the heat map, the “White” category shows significantly high usage levels for certain substances, whereas many other racial groups exhibit lighter-shaded cells, indicating lower frequencies.\nThe second factor is employment status, which connects to individual’s economic status strongly, thus has an impact on someone’s consumption that they afford specific drug, or they become addicted because of poverty. We try to verify which statement is correct according to this dataset.\n\n\nCode\nmosaic(~ EMPLOY + SUB1, \n       data = data_top4_all,\n       direction = c(\"v\", \"h\"),  \n       gp_labels = gpar(fontsize = 7),\n       gp_varnames = gpar(fontsize = 9),\n       main_gp = gpar(fontsize = 15),\n       labeling_args = list(\n         set_varnames = c(EMPLOY = \"EMPLOY\", SUB1 = \"Substances\"),\n         rot_labels = c(left = 0)\n         ),\n       margins = unit(c(1, 1, 1, 5), \"lines\"),\n       gp = gpar(fill = c(\"lightblue\", \"lightblue\", \"lightblue\", \"lightblue\", \n                          \"lightpink\", \"lightpink\", \"lightpink\", \"lightpink\",\n                          \"peachpuff1\", \"peachpuff1\", \"peachpuff1\", \"peachpuff1\",\n                          \"lightgreen\", \"lightgreen\", \"lightgreen\", \"lightgreen\"))\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this plot, it can be seen that except alcohol seems to have an obviously larger proportion in Full-time category, other proportions seem similar in the mosaic plot. However, we still need to use the stacked bar chat to check if the total amount of substance usage corresponds with employment status. Alcohol is extremely high in full-time group, proving that our second guess “they become addicted because of poverty” makes more sense here.\n\n\nCode\ndata_summary_employ &lt;- data |&gt;\n  group_by(EMPLOY) |&gt;\n  summarise(total_count = n()) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total_count))\n\ndata$EMPLOY &lt;- factor(data$EMPLOY, levels = data_summary_employ$EMPLOY)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data, aes(x = EMPLOY, fill = SUB1)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"stack\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Abuse Type by Employment\",\n    x = \"EMPLOY\",\n    y = \"Count\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +\n  scale_fill_discrete(name = NULL) +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(ncol = 2)) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1, size = 8),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 8),\n    legend.title = element_text(size = 10),\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stacked bar chart illustrates how the primary substance used varies across different employment status. It is not surprising that Unemployed corresponds to the highest number of substances used. However, it is surprising that Part-time has the lowest substance usage, and the usage is much lower than all other categories. We guess this may be correlated with working pressure, since Full-time and Not in labor force may have much higher working pressure than part-time. Part time people have a better work-live balance, which is a good advice when it comes to prevent addiction.\n\n\nCode\ntable_1 &lt;- table(data$EMPLOY, data$SUB1)\ndf_table_1 &lt;- as.data.frame(table_1)\ncolnames(df_table_1) &lt;- c(\"EMPLOY\", \"SUB1\", \"Freq\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df_table_1, aes(x = EMPLOY, y = SUB1, fill = Freq)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\") + \n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"white\", high = \"steelblue\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Abuse Type Heatmap by Employment\",\n    x = \"EMPLOY\",\n    y = \"Substances\",\n    fill = \"Count\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the heatmap, we can see that certain substances, such as Alcohol and Heroin, have relatively higher counts among the Unemployed and Not in labor force groups compared to others. In contrast, categories like Cocaine/crack or Barbiturates are used less frequently across all employment categories, resulting in lighter-colored cells. Also, it can be seen that the density for Part-time are low for all substances. In all, main type of addiction has a similar pattern in 3 employment status, but full time people mainly abuse alcohol.\nAnother factor is age, and it’s heartbroken to see nearly 10k respondents in this dataset are under 18.\n\n\nCode\ntop_sub1 &lt;- data |&gt;\n  count(SUB1, sort = TRUE) |&gt;\n  slice_head(n = 3) |&gt;\n  pull(SUB1)\n\ndata_top3_sub &lt;- data |&gt;\n  filter(SUB1 %in% top_sub1)\n\ndata_top3_sub &lt;- data_top3_sub |&gt; droplevels()\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmosaic(~ AGE + SUB1, \n       data = data_top3_sub,\n       direction = c(\"v\", \"h\"),  \n       gp_labels = gpar(fontsize = 6),\n       gp_varnames = gpar(fontsize = 9),\n       main_gp = gpar(fontsize = 15),\n       labeling_args = list(\n         set_varnames = c(AGE = \"AGE\", SUB1 = \"Substances\"),\n         rot_labels = c(left = 0, top = 30)\n         ),\n       margins = unit(c(1, 1, 1, 5), \"lines\"),\n       gp = gpar(fill = c(\"lightblue\", \"lightblue\", \"lightblue\", \"lightblue\", \"lightblue\", \"lightblue\", \"lightblue\", \"lightblue\", \"lightblue\", \"lightblue\", \"lightblue\", \"lightblue\",\n                          \"lightpink\", \"lightpink\", \"lightpink\", \"lightpink\", \"lightpink\", \"lightpink\", \"lightpink\", \"lightpink\", \"lightpink\", \"lightpink\", \"lightpink\", \"lightpink\",\n                          \"peachpuff1\", \"peachpuff1\", \"peachpuff1\", \"peachpuff1\", \"peachpuff1\", \"peachpuff1\", \"peachpuff1\", \"peachpuff1\", \"peachpuff1\", \"peachpuff1\", \"peachpuff1\", \"peachpuff1\",\n                          \"lightgreen\", \"lightgreen\", \"lightgreen\", \"lightgreen\", \"lightgreen\", \"lightgreen\", \"lightgreen\", \"lightgreen\", \"lightgreen\", \"lightgreen\", \"lightgreen\", \"lightgreen\"))\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this plot, it can be seen that alcohol is extremely used in both end of age, young or old. Heroin becomes prevalent in adult. And what’s most important is methamphetamine has a young pattern–young people are more easily to get addicted, which is another advice we get from this research.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data, aes(x = AGE, fill = SUB1)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"stack\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Abuse Type by Age\",\n    x = \"AGE\",\n    y = \"Count\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_discrete(name = NULL) +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(ncol = 2)) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 10),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 8),\n    legend.title = element_text(size = 10)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stacked bar chart illustrates how the primary substance used varies across different age groups. The middle-age ranges (around 30–39 years old) show the highest counts and a diverse mix of substances. Younger age groups (e.g., 12–20 years old) have lower overall counts, with fewer substance types represented. Older age groups (50 years and above) still demonstrate a variety of substances, but each substance tends to make up a smaller proportion compared to the middle-aged peak. This suggests that the middle-age range may be a period of particularly high diversity and intensity of substance use, while both younger and older groups show more limited but still distinct patterns of substance preferences.\n\n\nCode\ntable_3 &lt;- table(data$AGE, data$SUB1)\ndf_table_3 &lt;- as.data.frame(table_3)\ncolnames(df_table_3) &lt;- c(\"AGE\", \"SUB1\", \"Freq\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df_table_3, aes(x = AGE, y = SUB1, fill = Freq)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\") + \n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"white\", high = \"steelblue\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Abuse Type Heatmap by Age\",\n    x = \"AGE\",\n    y = \"Substances\",\n    fill = \"Count\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 8)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the heat map, among all substances, alcohol, heroin, Marijuana/hashish, Methamphetamine/speed, and Other opiates and synthetics are substances that are used the most. Also, age range from around 25 to 65 are the range that has most substances usage.\nFinally to see how strong the addiction is, we decide to use alluvial graph to represent.\n\n\nCode\nset.seed(123) \nsample_size &lt;- floor(0.0005 * nrow(data))\nsample_data &lt;- data[sample(nrow(data), size = sample_size), ]\n\ntop_sub1 &lt;- sample_data |&gt;\n  count(SUB1, sort = TRUE) |&gt;\n  slice_head(n = 4) |&gt;\n  pull(SUB1)\n\nsample_data_sub &lt;- sample_data |&gt;\n  filter(SUB1 %in% top_sub1)\n\nsample_data_sub$FREQ1 &lt;- factor(sample_data_sub$FREQ1, levels = c(\"Daily use\", \"Some use\", \"No use in the past month\"))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(sample_data_sub, \n       aes(axis1 = SUB1, axis2 = FREQ1, y = 1, fill = SUB1)) +\n  geom_alluvium(width = 1/12, knot.pos = 0.5, alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_stratum(width = 1/12, color = \"black\") +\n  geom_text(stat = \"stratum\", aes(label = after_stat(stratum)), size = 3) +\n  scale_x_discrete(labels = c(\"GENDER\", \"AGE\", \"SUB1\")) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Variables\",\n    y = NULL\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n    axis.ticks = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the alluvial diagram, it can be observed that alcohol and marijuana are relatively easier to get rid of, while heroin and methamphetamine have strong addiction, people would have to keep a daily use frequency because of addiction. Overall, the alluvial diagram suggests that strong addiction pattern appears in methamphetamine and heroin. As discussed above, these two drugs are in younger and middle age group, more effort are needed to prevent such addiction.",

    "text": "In this part we will discuss our findings from the TEDS-A dataset.\nDuring our research, The first conclusion is the opinions towards drugs are severely affected by culture, example that Indian are more conservative towards drugs while white people behave a more open mind is shown, this opinion is manifested in the number of abuse and categories. In short, open culture and opinion causes much more addiction.\nFurthermore, we verify our hypothesis that respondents become addicted because of poverty and reject that employment has an impact on someone’s consumption that they afford drugs. What’s surprising is that Part-time has the lowest substance usage, and the usage is much lower than all other categories. So our second main conclusion is work-live balance helps relieve work pressure, and makes an important contribution to addiction prevention.\nOur third finding concerning respondents is methamphetamine has a young pattern–younger people are more easily to get addicted. So more effort is needed to educate, protect the minors and prevent addiction to drugs like methamphetamine from them.\nFinally another conclusion is about addictiveness of drugs listed here. Heroin and methamphetamine have strong addiction, people would have to keep a daily use frequency because of addiction compared to alcohol, so we should be extremely cautious about these drugs when we deal with them.\nThere are some work could be done in the future: 1.Expand the analysis to include longitudinal data for tracking addiction patterns over time. This dataset only contain one year data, so time pattern is hard to see.\n2.Investigate additional cultural and regional factors to further refine prevention strategies. During our research, our insight to these factors is still shallow, problems like how culture affects addiction in detail, from Behaviorally to mentally, could be studied more.\n3.Explore the role of mental health and social support systems in addiction prevention and recovery. In this work, content related to mental health is scarce. However, this is an important aspect when it comes to addiction. More work could be done to analysis it’s effect on education, prevention and recovery.",
