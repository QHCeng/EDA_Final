# Conclusion
In this part we will discuss our findings from the TEDS-A dataset. 

During our research, The first conclusion is the opinions towards drugs are severely affected by culture, example that Indian are more conservative towards drugs while white people behave a more open mind is shown, this opinion is manifested in the number of abuse and categories. In short, open culture and opinion causes much more addiction.

Furthermore, we verify our hypothesis that respondents become addicted because of poverty and reject that employment has an impact on someone's consumption that they afford drugs. What's surprising is that Part-time has the lowest substance usage, and the usage is much lower than all other categories. So our second main conclusion is work-live balance helps relieve work pressure, and makes an important contribution to addiction prevention.

Our third finding concerning respondents is methamphetamine has a young pattern--younger people are more easily to get addicted. So more effort is needed to educate, protect the minors and prevent addiction to drugs like methamphetamine from them.

Finally another conclusion is about addictiveness of drugs listed here. Heroin and methamphetamine have strong addiction, people would have to keep a daily use frequency because of addiction compared to alcohol, so we should be extremely cautious about these drugs when we deal with them.
